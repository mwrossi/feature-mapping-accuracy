# feature-mapping-accuracy

### Description
The script _synthetic_feature_maps_main.py_ allows the user to generate synthetic 'truth' and 'model' data across a range of feature fractions. After specifying the size of the scene, the error scenario, and associated parameters, this script will generate plots of F1 score and normalized MCC for a range of values of feature fraction. Results are saved as a _.csv_ file in the local directory.

### Requirements
packages: _numpy 1.23.5_, _scipy 1.10.0_, _matplotlib 3.7.0_  
scripts: _synthetic_feature_maps_main.py_, _synthetic_feature_maps_function.py_
